This is a clock.
----------------

Actually, there's nothing to be said here. This is not (yet) an app.
That clock was created for a simple amusement and trying out some fun stuff
(like creating SVG graphics by writing XML).

Over time, it might get complicated, though. I have few ideas on how to
add new functionalities or improve the clock itself (better synchro!).
Ironically, time itself is (as always) against me. So I'll improve this
if I can find the time.
